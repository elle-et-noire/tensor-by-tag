## Why these codes are here

[ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl) is a very useful library when you try to implement some tensor network calculations in Julia. The key feature of this library is that each index of a tensor is a instance of `Index` and accompanied by some informations such as `dim`, `id` or `tags`. But `id`, which is automatically generated by the library, sometimes become a hindrance when you want to identify indices only by `tags`, which can be controlled by a programmer. Such a situation occurs especially in the context of tensor renormalization, where a produced tensor is duplicated and reused. Even though the `prime` system is prepared in ITensor, `prime`-engineered code becomes dirty and loses the good point of ITensor, that the reader can keep track of contractions via the `Index` variables, without caring the order of indices.


In this repository I put a piece of codes where the tensor operation can be specified only by the tag name of each indices with some examples. Please be careful that the calculation cost is not taken into account.
